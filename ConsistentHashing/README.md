### What is Consistent Hashing

> Consistent Hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table by assigning them a position on an abstract circle, or hash ring. 
> This allows servers and objects to scale without affecting the overall system.
