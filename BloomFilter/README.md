### What is a Bloom Filter

> A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is based on hashing. <br>
> It is extremely space efficient and is typically used to add elements to a set and test if an element is in a set. <br>
> Though, the elements themselves are not added to a set. Instead a hash of the elements is added to the set.
